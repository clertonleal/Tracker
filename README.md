Tracker
=======

A simple concept project of a tracker workout application for Android. This application use unit tests with Junit, Maven build, injecting dependencies with RoboGuice and ORM persistence with ORMLite.

###Warning, this project is deprecated and will be updated as soon as possible. Currently I prefer the native testing framework for android. Roboguice should be replaced by Dagger + Butter knife. Build a maven was discontinued. Gradle is the best option currently.
